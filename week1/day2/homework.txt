Homework


Run each of the following lines of code.
What happens? Does it work? Does it not work? Why? What could be changed to make it work?



1.
print x

/* code did NOT work. x is not defined. needs to be: print "x" */


2.
x = 4
y = 'y'
print x + y

/* code did NOT work. y is defined as a string and not an integer, y must be given an integer value */


3.
x = 'Hello'
y = 'World'
print x + y

/* code DID work. Screen printed HelloWorld. Spaces could be added to make it more readable */


4.
x = 'x'
y = 'x'
print x + y

/* code DID work. Screen printed xx. */


5.
x = x
y = 'y'
print x + y

/* code did NOT work. x was not defined. should be x = 'x' */


6.
x = 'x'
y = x + 'y'
print x + y

/* code DID work. Screen printed xxy */


7.
x = 'Hello'
y = 4
print x / y

/* code did NOT work. Can't divide a String by an Integer */


8.
x = 'Hello'
y = 'World'
print x * y

/* code did NOT work. Can't multiply two Strings. */
